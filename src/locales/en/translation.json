    "title1": "RFID BASIC CONCEPT",
    "title1_sub": "To use an RFID system, each product must be tagged with a chip. This chip connected to an antenna interacts with various inventory tags, allowing reading and monitoring of the product's unique EPC (Electronic Product Code) and other information.",
    "title1_sub2": "RFID readers, whether stationary or mobile devices, connect to these tags via antennas and activate them by sending a certain amount of energy, enabling data transmission to the system. The readers then act as a bridge, making tag data available for business applications.",
    "title1_sub3": "The core of the system is the application software that integrates all components including tags, readers, and data. This software is crucial for data processing, providing businesses with effective inventory management and control capabilities, enabling seamless operation of the RFID system.",
